- **Features**: Full CRUD operations with pagination and filtering

### **3. Data Validation & Error Handling**
- **Fixed**: Template validation for journey assignments
- **Fixed**: Date calculation errors in journey completion
- **Fixed**: Member ID validation and dynamic lookup

### **4. Production Seed Data Integration**
- **Implemented**: Real production-like data with valid IDs
- **Fixed**: Frontend-backend ID mismatches
- **Added**: Dynamic ID resolution for testing
