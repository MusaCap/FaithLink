# Backend Startup Hang Resolution

## Issue Summary
The FaithLink360 Express server was experiencing a critical startup hang that prevented the backend API from becoming available, blocking Sprint 2 development.

## Root Cause Analysis
After systematic debugging, the issue was identified as:
- **Direct PrismaClient import** in `src/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`
- This caused the import chain: `server.ts` → `auth.ts` → `PrismaClient` → startup hang
- Even when database code was disabled in `server.ts`, the auth routes import still triggered PrismaClient initialization

## Solution Implementation
1. **Removed direct PrismaClient import** from `auth.ts`
2. **Updated auth routes** to use shared PrismaClient via `req.app.locals.prisma`
3. **Regenerated Prisma client** for Debian platform compatibility
4. **Re-enabled all routes** and database connectivity

## Files Modified
- `src/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`: Removed `import { PrismaClient }`, updated route handlers
- `src/backend/src/server.ts`: Re-enabled PrismaClient initialization and auth routes
- `.gitignore`: Added node_modules to prevent GitHub file size issues

## Testing Status
✅ Backend startup hang resolved  
✅ Auth routes working with shared PrismaClient  
✅ Members routes re-enabled for Sprint 2  
✅ GitHub repository updated with fixes  

## Prevention
- Use shared PrismaClient instance via `app.locals.prisma` in all route files
- Avoid direct PrismaClient imports in route handlers
- Test container startup after any Prisma-related changes

## Sprint Impact
This fix unblocks Sprint 2 member directory CRUD development and testing.
