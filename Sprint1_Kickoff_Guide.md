## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Firebase connection issues | Medium | High | Have Airtable backup plan ready |
| Bubble.io learning curve | High | Medium | Allocate extra time for tutorials |
| Mobile responsiveness problems | Medium | High | Test early and frequently |
| Authentication complexity | Low | High | Use Bubble.io native auth first |

### Contingency Plans

**If Firebase Integration Fails:**
- Switch to Airtable backend (2-day delay)
- Use Bubble.io native database temporarily
- Implement Firebase later in Sprint 2

**If Mobile Responsiveness Issues:**
- Focus on tablet-first design
- Implement mobile-specific pages
- Use Bubble.io responsive engine
