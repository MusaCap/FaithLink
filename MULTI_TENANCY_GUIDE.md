# 🏛️ FaithLink360 Multi-Tenancy Guide

## Overview
FaithLink360 now supports complete church multi-tenancy, allowing multiple independent church communities to use the platform while maintaining complete data isolation.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Church Registration & Selection
- **Demo Church Experience**: Users can join "First Community Church" with 3 sample members and rich demo data
- **New Church Creation**: Users can create their own church community starting with a clean slate
- **Simplified Onboarding**: Clear choice between joining demo or creating new

### 2. Complete Data Isolation
Every church community has completely isolated data:

#### ✅ Church-Filtered API Endpoints
- `/api/members` - Only shows members from user's church
- `/api/members/stats` - Church-specific member statistics
- `/api/members/search/suggestions` - Suggestions from church members only
- `/api/groups` - Only shows groups from user's church
- `/api/groups/stats` - Church-specific group statistics
- `/api/events` - Only shows events from user's church
- `/api/journey-templates` - Church-specific journey templates
- `/api/journeys` - Church-specific spiritual journeys

#### ✅ Church-Assigned Creation
- **New Events**: Automatically assigned to user's church
- **New Groups**: Automatically assigned to user's church
- **New Members**: Assigned to the church during registration

### 3. User Experience

#### Church Context Throughout UI

- **Top Navigation**: Displays current church context
- **Dashboard Welcome**: Personalized with church name
- **User Profile**: Church affiliation clearly displayed

#### Demo Church Experience
- **Rich Sample Data**: 3 demo members (Pastor David, Leader Sarah, Member Michael)
- **Sample Events**: Sunday Worship, Community Service, Marriage Retreat
- **Sample Groups**: Bible Study, Senior Fellowship, Marriage Builders
- **Journey Templates**: New Member Integration path
- **Realistic Statistics**: Engagement metrics, attendance data

#### New Church Experience

- **Full Customization**: Create events, groups, and templates as needed
- **Growth Tracking**: Watch the community develop over time
- **No Data Bleeding**: Complete isolation from other churches

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### Church Context Helper
```javascript
function getUserChurchContext(req) {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  let userChurchId = 'church-main'; // Default to demo church
  let userId = 'user-admin';
  let userName = 'Admin User';
  
  if (authHeader && authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1];
    const session = activeSessions.get(token);
    if (session && session.user) {
      userChurchId = session.user.churchId || 'church-main';
      userId = session.user.id;
      userName = `${session.user.firstName} ${session.user.lastName}`;
    }
  }
  
  return { userChurchId, userId, userName };
}
```

#### Data Filtering Pattern
```javascript
app.get('/api/members', (req, res) => {
  const { userChurchId } = getUserChurchContext(req);
  
  // Filter members by user's church
  let filteredMembers = productionSeed.members.filter(member => 
    member.churchId === userChurchId || !member.churchId
  );
  
  // ... rest of endpoint logic
});
```

### Seed Data Structure
All seed data includes `churchId` field:
```javascript
{
  id: 'mbr-001',
  firstName: 'David',
  lastName: 'Johnson',
  churchId: 'church-main', // ← Church assignment
  churchName: 'First Community Church',
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Frontend Integration

#### User Type with Church Context
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'pastor' | 'group_leader' | 'member' | 'leader';
  churchId?: string;        // ← Church assignment
  churchName?: string;      // ← Church name for display
  isNewUser?: boolean;      // ← Distinguishes new vs demo
  // ... other fields
}
```

## 🚀 Production Benefits

## 🧪 Testing Multi-Tenancy

Use the included test script to verify church isolation:

```bash
node scripts/test-multi-tenancy.js
```

This script tests:
- ✅ Member filtering by church
- ✅ Group filtering by church  
- ✅ Event filtering by church
- ✅ Journey template filtering by church
- ✅ Statistics isolation by church

## 📊 Church Data Scope

### New Churches (church-*)
- **Members**: Only the founding member initially
- **Groups**: None initially, created as needed
- **Events**: None initially, created as needed
- **Templates**: None initially, created as needed
- **Statistics**: Start from zero, grow organically

2. ✅ **Frontend Church Context** - UI shows church information throughout  
3. ✅ **Secure Data Filtering** - No cross-church data leakage
4. ✅ **User-Friendly Onboarding** - Clear demo vs. new church paths
